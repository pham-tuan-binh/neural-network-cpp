# **Binh's Neural Network** Progress Report

# Brief

The project's official title is **"Neural Network Proof of Concept in Mathematical Function Approximation"**. However, this is too long, therefore it will be called **"Binh's Neural Network"** from this point on in any other documentations of the project.

# Progress

The project is in its **Finished** state. You can find the documentation inside **/docs/** directory in the project root.

In the future, further improvements can be added in, per the instructor or lecturer request.

# Documentation

You can find the documentation inside **/docs/** directory in the project root.

In there, you can find the information on how to run the program. But not to waste your time, this is how the project should be run.

```BASH
# Run these scripts in the project root
# These scripts are written by me to automate the process

# To run the project (Project must be built first)
./run.sh

# To build the project (without running it)
./build.sh

# To build the project, then run it
./build_and_run.sh
```

I packaged the project with the build already, so you can just run it from the **"run.sh"** script. However, I reccomend running **"build_and_run.sh"** just as a precaution.
